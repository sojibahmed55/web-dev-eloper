        <p>The name of our country is the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. It is one of the most beautiful countries
          in the world. Our country was a part of Pakistan before 1971. Then we freed our country and achieved victory
          after nine month’s liberation war. 3 million people sacrificed their lives in the liberation war in 1971.
          Our independence day is 26th March and Victory day is 16th December. The national language of our country is
          Bangla.

          It is also a matter of great pride for us that we are the only nation that sacrificed their lives for the
          sake of their mother tongue on 21st February of 1952. In order to show respect to them, UNESCO has declared
          21st February as International Mother Language Day. The name of the capital of Bangladesh is Dhaka. It is
          the busiest and populated city in our country. The total population is 16 crore. The total area of our
          country is 1,47,570 square km.

          Our country is a river-oriented country. The main rivers of our country are Padma, Jamuna, Meghna. But due
          to pollution and river pollution, all of these rivers have shrunk. People of all religions live peacefully
          in this country but most of them are Muslim. The famous places for tourist’s visit to our country are
          Sundarban, Cox’sBazar, St Martin, Kuakata. Sundarban is the largest Mangrove forest in the world. Cox’s
          Bazar has the longest sea beach.</p>
